## Compiled CSS and JS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for **Bootstrap v** to easily drop into your project, which includes:

- Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see [CSS files comparison]())
- Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins (see [JS files comparison]())

This doesn't include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.

## Source files

Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:

- [Sass compiler]() for compiling Sass source files into CSS files
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require our full set of [build tools](), they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they're likely unsuitable for your own purposes.
