Have a need for Bootstrap's brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well.

## Logo

When referencing Bootstrap, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Bootstrap's branding for your own open or closed source projects.
